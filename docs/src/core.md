# Core --- Parts and Usage Overview

The code is divided up into files to contain pieces with similar purposes or concepts in the algorithm. Each file has its own single module for defining a namespace used when importing its names into other files. Each module exports members intended for public access, but the code in this project explicitly names its imports to maintain clarity in what is used and where it comes from.
