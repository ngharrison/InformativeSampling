This repository is divided into two parts: a package and an application.

The package is the core functionality --- the general informative sampling routine. This part includes things like the belief models, map data structures, sample selection optimization, and the main mission loop.

The application is code that uses and tests the informative sampling package in specific scenarios. This part has things to do with the inputs and outputs to informative sampling missions --- the data generation, saving, visualization, and analysis.

See the sections in the sidebar to learn more details.
