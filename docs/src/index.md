This repository is divided into three parts: a core package, utilities, and an application.

The package is the core functionality --- the general informative sampling routine. This part includes things like the belief models, map data structures, sample selection optimization, and the main mission loop.

The utilities are things that deal with informative sampling data --- both inputs and outputs. They provide common routines to aid in constructing, visualizing, and analyzing missions.

The application is code that uses and tests the informative sampling package in specific scenarios. It contains the data itself and scripts to run all the other code.

See the sections in the sidebar to learn more details.
