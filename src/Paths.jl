"""
Struct for PathCost function data. Previous computations are kept track of in
its data. Can be used multiple times for the same start cell, saving
computation.

The costMap's cells contain the distance to them from the start cell. NaN is a
placeholder meaning no path has been calculated to that cell yet. Inf means
that cell is not reachable from the start cell.
